# Statistics in R
The statistics course I am studying has a part with applications in R. In the problems.pdf file there are all the problems the teachers have given to us, in the solutions folder there are my solutions. I won't solve every problem, at some point I get to master them and they get boring, so when I have a feeling that I am not gaining anything I will stop solving. 
I have put this in my machine learning repo, as the R language is relevant to todays ML, so I thought this has a place here.
